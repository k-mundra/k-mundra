## Hey there👋 I'm Kashvi!

I love:

### Scientific Machine Learning • Aerospace • Simulation & Optimization

I’m a Computational Science & Engineering grad student at Georgia Tech working on multi-fidelity neural networks, physics-informed modeling, and uncertainty quantification. I enjoy building ML-driven simulation tools, studying numerical behavior, and solving complex engineering problems with computational methods.

My undergraduate degree was in Aerospace Engineering. I have experience working with rockets, jet engines, and controlled systems. Ex ULA, Pratt & Whitney.
